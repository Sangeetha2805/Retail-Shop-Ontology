# Retail Shop Ontology: Semantic Representation and Insights

## Overview
This project involves creating a semantic ontology for a retail shop using the Protege tool. The ontology is designed to manage perishable and non-perishable goods, track product attributes, and analyze key relationships. The workflow includes preprocessing the ontology in OWL format, performing topic modeling to extract key insights, and visualizing the ontology's structure in Neo4j.

## Workflow
### 1. **Ontology Creation**
- **Tool**: [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/)
- **Purpose**: Design an ontology for retail shop management, focusing on:
  - Managing perishable and non-perishable goods.
  - Handling attributes like manufacturing/expiry dates, product rates, and warehouse locations.
  - Connecting entities using object and data properties.

### 2. **Ontology Preprocessing**
- The OWL file is uploaded and processed using:
  - **rdflib**: To parse the ontology.
  - **Topic Modeling**: To extract key terms from ontology concepts using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation).

### 3. **Visualization in Neo4j**
- **Neo4j**: Used to visualize the ontology and perform graph-based queries.
- **Cypher Queries**: Extracted specific concepts and relationships.

## Features
- **Semantic Representation**: Provides structured data representation for retail shop management.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Uses topic modeling to identify key terms and patterns in the ontology.
- **Interactive Graph Visualization**: Highlights entity relationships, subclasses, and properties in Neo4j.

## Project Structure
